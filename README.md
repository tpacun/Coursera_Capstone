# Boston Real Estate and Venue Data Analysis

The Greater Boston Metro area is one of the most expensive places to live in the United States. As the tenth largest metropolitan statistical area in the US, Boston is home to a continuously growing population of approximately 4.8 million people. This project aims to discover more information about Bostonian zip codes and the mostpopular venues within each. Additionally it will look at the possibility of segmenting, classifying, and modeling the median prices of the neighborhood.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, MatPlotLib, SciKit-Learn, and others)

This main basis for this project is an open source set of real estate data provided by Zillow. Using a set of Python libraries, I did basic exploratory data analysis on the set before seeing if we could find any meaninful correlations or models that provided significant results.

I would normally include more information here, but there is a lot more detail on my methodology in the report linked above.

## Lessons Learned:

That planning out how you are going to approach a project is essential! Doing exploratory data analysis was and is helpful, but then stepping back a moment and planning out next steps to avoide project creep would have been helpful in this instance.

Technically speaking, as with any data analysis project (which is inevitably going to require data cleaning), I learned some new methods for encoding data and making it useful. I also really enjoyed learning how to use the Folium library which enabled me to create some cool geogrphical visualizations.
